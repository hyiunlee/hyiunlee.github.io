            Scandal
            That Shook the K-pop Industry</a></h4>
    <h5>May 5, 2019</h5>
    <p>In February 2019, one of the biggest scandals arose to flip the image of the K-pop industry upside down.
        A
        scandal that originally started off with one person has uncovered the involvement of at least six more
        celebrities (with more to be revealed). It all began two months ago with one of K-pop’s biggest stars, a
        member
        of Big Bang, Seungri. CCTV footage of an assault was found at a club he owned called “Burning Sun.”
        Since then,
        allegations have been held against a group of people for sexual assault and bribing of the police
        community.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://saseye.com/2019/11/15/the-tiktok-epidemic-at-sas/" target="_blank">The Tiktok Epidemic
            at
            SAS</a></h4>
    <h5>November 15, 2019</h5>
    <p>Though the Tiktok trend at SAS is not without its detractors (and recently associated with undesirable
        representations of SAS students on the internet), we cannot deny that the positive tendencies of this
        phenomenon
        are overwhelming. Here we interview current students who seem to have a fixation to this social media
        app but
        have also gained thousands of views and followers. Clearly, Tiktok—once known as a cringe app—has won
        new
        epidemic status in 2019.</p>
