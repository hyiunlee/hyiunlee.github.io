            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Haradan was born in 1744 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. As a boy he worked in Salem for the prominent
                merchant and future Senator George Cabot. He joined the Massachusetts State Navy in July 1776 as First
                Lieutenant of the sloop-of-war Tyrannicide, fourteen guns. On board for two years, he captured many
                prizes, becoming her commander in 1777. The ship was scuttled during the Penobscot Expedition.[1]

                In 1778, Haraden began his career as a privateersman, commanding the General Pickering, sloop of
                fourteen guns. On October 13, 1779, he engaged three British privateers off New Jersey simultaneously
                and captured a twenty-two gun sloop in the Bay of Biscay. When the larger British privateer, Achilles of
                forty guns, attempted to recapture the sloop a few days later, Haraden forced it to disengage after
                three hours' action at close quarters. In 1781, he was briefly captured by Admiral George Rodney in the
                West Indies, but escaped. Haraden sailed privateer Julius Caesar in 1782.[2]

                After the War of Independence, Haraden's health deteriorated steadily. He died in Salem, Massachusetts
                in 1803. He was buried in Salem's Broad Street Cemetery.[3]</p>
