    <p><i>These juicy, boneless chicken thighs are dipped in a light batter to form an extra-crispy crust, then
            lacquered
            with a gingery hot pepper paste for a version of classic Korean fried chicken that totally rules the
            roost.<br><br>Serve it as a snack on its own, or pair with rice and steamed or roasted vegetables to make it
            a
            meal.</i></p>

            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vodka</li>
            <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Special Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A deep-fry thermometer</li>
    </ul>
    <!--The steps that are needed for this recipe-->
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and place near stove. Set deep-fry thermometer in a heavy wide
            pot, then pour in oil to a depth of 1 1/2". Heat over high until thermometer registers 350ºF.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until lightly
            golden, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in same skillet over medium. Add ginger and scallion whites. Cook, stirring frequently,
            until scallions are tender, about 1 minute. Whisk in gochujang and brown sugar, bring just to a simmer, then
            remove from heat. Add 1/4 cup water; whisk to combine. Transfer sauce to a large bowl and cover to keep
            warm; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch, flour, salt, baking powder, and a generous pinch of pepper in another large bowl. Add
            vodka and 1/2 cup cold water, then whisk until a smooth, loose batter forms. Add chicken and toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Using tongs, remove chicken from batter, letting excess drip back into bowl. Transfer to hot oil and cook,
            working in batches if needed, stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon to keep pieces from sticking
            together, and adjusting heat as needed to maintain 350ºF, until chicken is golden and crispy, 6–8 minutes
            per batch.</li>
        <li>Transfer fried chicken to prepared rack. Add chicken to reserved sauce and carefully toss to coat. Transfer
            to a serving platter. Top with reserved toasted sesame seeds and scallion greens.</li>
    </ol>
