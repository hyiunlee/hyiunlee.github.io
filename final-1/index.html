                    <p> Animal testing refers to any scientific experiments and procedures carried out on living
                        animals
                        for
                        the purposes of basic biology and disease research, evaluating the efficacy of new medicinal
                        products, and testing for the human health and safety of consumer and industrial products
                        such
                        as
                        cosmetics, food additives, and industrial chemicals. Furthermore, before new medications are
                        used by humans, researchers must test them to evaluate
                        both their positive and negative effects. Animals are utilized because their biology is
                        highly similar to that of humans, not only in
                        basic activities like breathing, digesting, and mobility, but also in basic cell processes.
                        Thus, they make excellent models.</p>

                    <p>Every year, more than 115 million animals are projected to be
                        utilized in laboratory research
                        around the world. However, the exact number is unknown because only a tiny percentage of
                        countries collect and publish statistics on animal testing and research. The Animal Welfare
                        Act,
                        or AWA, is a federal law enacted in 1966 that regulates the treatment of animals in research
                        facilities. It mandates that certain animals raised for commercial sale, used in research,
                        transported commercially, or shown to the public receive minimal care and treatment.
                        However,
                        this rule exempts approximately 95% of animals that are tested on and gives only rudimentary
                        protections for the remainder.

                    <p>On the surface, animals and humans share similar symptoms, but basic variations in genetics,
                        physiology, and biochemistry can lead to divergent reactions to the illness and potential
                        therapies.
                        Such reasons and overreliance on animal models in several areas of illness study may have slowed
                        rather than accelerated medical development.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The FDA, officially known as the United States Food and Drug Administration, reported that
                            92% of drugs entering clinical trials after animal testing was rejected. Moreover, half of
                            the 8% authorized were later withdrawn or relabeled as a result of severe or lethal side
                            effects not found during animal testing. </li>
                        <li>According to a report by Dr. Jarrod Bailey, a geneticist and science advisor, 85 HIV/AIDS
                            vaccines that have been successful in animal experiments have failed to protect humans,
                            while some feel it rendered them more susceptible to the disease.</li>
                        <li>Published in the Journal “Annals of Internal Medicine,” it revealed that attempting to mimic
                            human diseases intentionally producing symptoms in animals has scientific constraints that
                            cannot be overcome. As a result, nine out of ten candidate treatments that appear to be safe
                            and effective in animal research fail when tested in humans.</li>

                        animal testing became
                        outdated and started to decrease in numbers as many countries began to prohibit the
                        manufacture
                        of such products. Nearly a hundred alternatives to animal experimentation have been discovered

                        today. These were
                        shown to be not only more efficient and cost-effective, but also more accurate. For instance...

                        2014 by researchers in the department of engineering science, the chips can be used instead of
                        animal tests and have been demonstrated to more accurately reproduce human physiology,
                        illnesses, and treatment reactions. <i>Watch <a

                        computer models that imitate human biology and disease progression. These models may accurately
                        anticipate how new medications would behave in the human body and can thus replace the use of
